## Where do I put the door?

The door needs not only to be able to be used by the general public, but also needs to be able to be used by those with disabilities. The following regulations ensure that doors abide by these standards ([link to the official document, pg. 56-66](https://threedimensionallandscapejournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1428-1-2009a1.pdf)):

## <a name="doorType">What type of door do I need?</a>

After the location of the door has been selected, you'll need to meet with a buildings code consultant to discuss the legal requirements of the door being constructed, based on the factors that you need to fulfil. It will be helpful to know the following information:

- **Building class**
  
  There are 10 classes, each detailed [here](https://www.abcb.gov.au/-/media/Files/Resources/Education-Training/Building-classifications.pdf).

- **Fire door locations**

If you'd like to attempt this without a consultant [here is a link](https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/NCC) to all the official resources (although you'll need to register an account to view the material). Attempting this without a consultant is not a good idea.
