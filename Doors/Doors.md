# DOORS

## What are doors?

#### *See other document for in-depth door definition and discussion*

As common as doors are, and as standardised as they may seem, doors come in a plethora of forms, each instance innate to its own environment and needs. They are a solution to a design problem alongside all other architectural elements - but what's the problem that they're actually solving?

Primarily, doors are the tool used to travel between two spaces on either side of a wall. They seperate the two spaces physically until a point in time where someone or something needs to travel from one to the other. In this process doors also minimise the energy expenditure needed to achieve this; rather than having to destroy the wall and rebuild it each time, the leaf of the door<sup>[1](#notes)</sup> rotates out of the way. Doors (when combined with walls) allow for travel between assymetric architectural spaces.

These assymetries dictate what the needs of the door are, including:

- Temperature levels (e.g. Aircon, fire protection)
- Noise transfer reductions
- Environmental (e.g. Wind, rain)
- Security enforceability

Further issues arise during the operation of the door, such as:

- Disabilities
- Security levels
- Traffic

The practical solutions of these issues (alongside the legality of certain door specifications) in the design is discussed in the section [What type of door do I need?](#doorType)

## Do I need a door?

As discussed above, the purpose of a door is to provide access between two assymetric architectural spaces. However, it is possible that there are similar desired conditions on either side of the door that means a door isn't warranted. If there are no:

 - Necessary differences in temperature,
 - Loud noises that need to be dampened,
 - Issues concerning security between the two spaces, or
 - possible wind or rainfall on either side,

It may be appropriate to have an empty space rather than a door. The empty space's frame will still definitively seperate the two areas, while reducing traffic issues and provide a sense of less constriction.

There are also some legal requirements to be aware of however (such as the need for two doors between each kitchen and bathroom). For all the legal requirements it must follow, see [the document on this page](https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/NCC). You will need to register if you want to download the documents, but it is free.

## Where do I put the door?

The door needs not only to be able to be used by the general public, but also needs to be able to be used by those with disabilities. The following regulations ensure that doors abide by these standards ([link to the official document, pg. 56-66](https://threedimensionallandscapejournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1428-1-2009a1.pdf)), which is required for any non-residential buildings & public sections of residential buildings (e.g. apartment foyers):

*Note: Some of these points will require you to [know what type of door you're putting in already](#doorType)

- Minimum of an 850mm width for the open space of the door:

- Following proportions given door type and approach angle:

 - For a surface mounted sliding door, the value of *t* in the following diagram (wall thickness to the surface of the door) should be added to the minimum surrounding space in the direction of approach:

 - When there are multiple doors in a row (collinear when open), they must be at least 1450mm apart when fully open:

Note: These guidelines don't always need to be met, however in buildings that will see use by a variety of people who may be disabled these are required.

## <a name="doorType">What type of door do I need?</a>

After the location of the door has been selected, you'll need to decide on what type of door to use (swing/sliding/pivot). ***HOW TO DECIDE DOOR TYPE***.

Once you've chosen a door type, you'll need to choose the materials of the door's frame and leaf. If you're working on a non-residential building (or a public section of a residential building), there needs to be a minimum of a 30% luminance contrast between the following items:

 - Door leaf and door jamb

 - Door leaf and adjacent wall
   
 - Architrave<sup>[2](#notes)</sup> and wall
   
 - Door leaf and architrave; OR
    
 - Door jamb and adjacent wall
   
The luminance contrast means the difference in reflected light between two objects. In order to calculate the luminance contrast, the Luminance Reflective Values (LRVs) of the different objects need to be known. Then, the Bowman-Sapolinksi equation can be used to calculate the luminance contrast - [here is an online calculator](https://luminos.com.au/luminous-calculator-bowman-sapolinski-equation/) that uses this.

***HOW TO DECIDE MATERIALS AFTER CONTRAST ESTABLISHED*** Possibly just aesthetics of surrounding architecture?


After you've decided on the materials for the door, you'll need to meet with a consultant (most likely from lockwood) to discuss the legal requirements of the door being constructed, based on the factors that you need to fulfil. It will be helpful to have the plan(s) of the door(s) you're discussing and to know what the purpose of the door is.

If you'd like to attempt this without a consultant [here is a link](https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/NCC) to all the official resources (although you'll need to register an account to view the material). Attempting this without a consultant is not a good idea (no-one does this). If you're unsure about any of the information required on ***THE SHEET***, the consultant can fill in the gaps.


***TALK ABOUT:***


DIMENSIONS STUFF?


Ensuring that those with disabilities can use the doors (required for any non-residential buildings & public sections of residential buildings - e.g. apartment foyers):

 - Door handles need to be 'hooked' so that when holding the handle people with less grip will still be able to hold on. The hook section needs to come towards the wall at least 20mmm, with the gap between the handle's arm and the door being somewhere between 35mm and 45mm:

 - For sliding doors, a similar logic applies except that both ends can attach to the door:

![Missing image](/Doors/Images/slidingHandle.png)

 - All pivot doors that need to be used by disabled people need to be motorised.

## <a name="notes">Notes</a>

<sup>1</sup>The leaf of the door is the large part of the door that actually moves. ![Image Missing](http://www.decosoup.com/images/stories/Design_Issues/Windows/Door_nomenclature/Door_terminilogy.jpg)

<sup>2</sup>The architrave is the outer part of the door frame (called casing in the above image), whereas the jamb is the inner part.
