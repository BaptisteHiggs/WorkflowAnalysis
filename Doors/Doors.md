# DOORS

## What are doors?

#### *See other document for in-depth door definition and discussion*

As common as doors are, and as standardised as they may seem, doors come in a plethora of forms, each instance innate to its own environment and needs. They are a solution to a design problem alongside all other architectural elements - but what's the problem?

Primarily, doors are the tool used to travel between two spaces on either side of a wall. They seperate the two spaces physically until a point in time where someone or something needs to travel from one to the other. In this process doors also minimise the energy expenditure needed to achieve this; rather than having to destroy the wall and rebuild it each time, the leaf of the door<sup>[1](#notes)</sup> rotates out of the way. Doors (when combined with walls) allow for travel between assymetric architectural spaces.

These assymetries dictate what the needs of the door are, including:

- Temperature levels (e.g. Aircon, fire protection)
- Noise transfer reductions
- Environmental (e.g. Wind, rain)
- Security enforceability

Further issues arise during the operation of the door, such as:

- Disabilities
- Security levels
- ***Something else??***

The practical solutions of these issues (alongside the legality of certain door specifications) in the design is discussed in the section [What type of door do I need?](#doorType)

## Do I need a door?

As discussed above, the purpose of a door is to provide access between two assymetric architectural spaces.

***Talk about whether an open space might be appropriate***

## Where do I put the door?

The door needs not only to be able to be used by the general public, but also needs to be able to be used by those with disabilities. The following regulations ensure that doors abide by these standards ([link to the official document, pg. 56-66](https://threedimensionallandscapejournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/1428-1-2009a1.pdf)):

After the location of the door has been selected, you'll need to meet with a buildings code consultant to discuss the legal requirements of the door being constructed, based on the factors that you need to fulfil. It will be helpful to know the following information:

- **Building class**
  
  There are 10 classes, each detailed [here](https://www.abcb.gov.au/-/media/Files/Resources/Education-Training/Building-classifications.pdf).

- **Fire door locations**

- 


If you'd like to attempt this without a consultant [here is a link](https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/NCC) to all the official resources (although you'll need to register an account to view the material). Attempting this without a consultant is not a good idea.
