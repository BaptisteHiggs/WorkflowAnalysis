# What are doors?

As common as doors are, and as standardised as they may seem, doors come in a lot of different shapes and sizes. It's usually fairly easy to tell what's a door and what isn't.

If I asked you to think of a door, you'd probably think of something pretty similar to the door pictured above. It has a rectangular shape, a handle, a leaf, a hinge, some casing and a flat wall to surround it. However, not all doors are as simple as this. Would you still call it a door if the handle was removed? What about the casing? The leaf? The problem is a lot harder than just asking if it has a certain set of elements.

## Definitions and perceptions

Definitions are inherently attempts at bridging the gap of qualia while appealing to other pre-defined terms, and so when attempting to define what a door is, it's important to acknowledge that no perfect definition can be reached but rather just a subjective attempt. Having said that, that's the nature of all defintions, and we can still try and find a compromising consensus on the term by observing what is and isn't considered to be a door. 

## A door's purpose.

*Why do we have doors?* Because if there was only wall, there would be no way of travelling into the space enclosed.
*Why don't we just have holes?* It depends. Sometimes we can, (***Note:*** Are holes in walls doors? I made the presumption here that they weren't, because it's difficult to proceed otherwise, although it could be argued that they are.) 

Primarily, doors are the tool used to travel between two spaces on either side of a wall. They seperate the two spaces physically until a point in time where someone or something needs to travel from one to the other. In this process doors also minimise the energy expenditure needed to achieve this; rather than having to destroy the wall and rebuild it each time, the leaf of the door<sup>[1](#notes)</sup> rotates out of the way. Doors (when combined with walls) allow for travel between assymetric architectural spaces.

These assymetries dictate what the needs of the door are, including:

- Temperature levels (e.g. Aircon, fire protection)
- Noise transfer reductions
- Environmental (e.g. Wind, rain)
- Security enforceability

Further issues arise during the operation of the door, such as:

- Disabilities
- Security levels
- ***Something else??***

The practical solutions of these issues (alongside the legality of certain door specifications) in the design is discussed in the section [What type of door do I need?](#doorType)

### Plan:

1.  Explanation of the common door and its parts

3.  When are doors used?

4.  Why do we use a door?

5.  Narrowing the definition of the door down by introducing grey-area examples
