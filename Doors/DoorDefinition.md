# What are doors?

As common as doors are, and as standardised as they may seem, doors come in a lot of different shapes and sizes. It's usually fairly easy to tell what is a door and what isn't.

If I asked you to think of a door, you'd probably think of something pretty similar to the door pictured above. It has a rectangular shape, a handle, a leaf, a hinge, some casing and a flat wall to surround it. However, not all doors are as simple as this. Would you still call it a door if the handle was removed? What about the casing? The leaf? The problem is a lot harder than just asking if it has a certain set of elements.

## A door's purpose.

To decide on what a door is and what a door isn't, we have to look at the purpose of a door.

Primarily, doors are the tool used to travel between two spaces on either side of a wall. They seperate the two spaces, but still allow for people to travel through between them. More than this, they minimise the amount of effort needed to go between two spaces; instead of destroying the wall each time and rebuilding it, the door provides a passageway.

This has been true for all of history. Some of the first doors documented were used as seperations between holy/sacred places and the outside world, most likely due to their expensive nature. In ~2490BC the pyramid of Giza had a door that seperated the king's tomb from the outer regions, and the door in Solomon's Temple (~850BC) seperated the "holy of holies" from the outer ring.

These assymetries dictate what the needs of the door are, including:

- Temperature levels (e.g. Aircon, fire protection)
- Noise transfer reductions
- Environmental (e.g. Wind, rain)
- Security enforceability

Further issues arise during the operation of the door, such as:

- Disabilities
- Security levels
- ***Something else??***

The practical solutions of these issues (alongside the legality of certain door specifications) in the design is discussed in the section [What type of door do I need?](#doorType)

### Plan:

1.  Explanation of the common door and its parts

3.  When are doors used?

4.  Why do we use a door?

5.  Narrowing the definition of the door down by introducing grey-area examples
