# What are doors?

As common as doors are, and as standardised as they may seem, doors come in a plethora of forms, each instance innate to its own environment and needs. Often, it's quite easy for us to distinguish between what is a door and what isn't.

The above diagram depicts a common door in the modern era. The three main parts of it include the leaf, the frame and the handle; however, if you were to remove one of these, can it still be considered a door? If there were no handle it's likely that you would still consider this to be a door, but how about the leaf? What if the frame and the handle are removed, but the leaf remained? Although practical for the most part, as doors remove themselves further from the classical definition and still remain 'doors' according to an overwhelming majority this definition breaks down fairly quickly.

## Definitions and perceptions

Definitions are inherently attempts at bridging the gap of qualia while appealing to other pre-defined terms, and so when attempting to define what a door is, it's important to acknowledge that no perfect definition can be reached but rather just a subjective attempt. Having said that, that's the nature of all defintions, and we can still try and find a compromising consensus on the term by observing what is and isn't considered to be a door. 

## A door's purpose.

*Why do we have doors?* Because if there was only wall, there would be no way of travelling into the space enclosed.
*Why don't we just have holes?* It depends. Sometimes we can, (***Note:*** Are holes in walls doors? I made the presumption here that they weren't, because it's difficult to proceed otherwise, although it could be argued that they are.) 

Primarily, doors are the tool used to travel between two spaces on either side of a wall. They seperate the two spaces physically until a point in time where someone or something needs to travel from one to the other. In this process doors also minimise the energy expenditure needed to achieve this; rather than having to destroy the wall and rebuild it each time, the leaf of the door<sup>[1](#notes)</sup> rotates out of the way. Doors (when combined with walls) allow for travel between assymetric architectural spaces.

These assymetries dictate what the needs of the door are, including:

- Temperature levels (e.g. Aircon, fire protection)
- Noise transfer reductions
- Environmental (e.g. Wind, rain)
- Security enforceability

Further issues arise during the operation of the door, such as:

- Disabilities
- Security levels
- ***Something else??***

The practical solutions of these issues (alongside the legality of certain door specifications) in the design is discussed in the section [What type of door do I need?](#doorType)

### Plan:

1.  Explanation of the common door and its parts

3.  When are doors used?

4.  Why do we use a door?

5.  Narrowing the definition of the door down by introducing grey-area examples
