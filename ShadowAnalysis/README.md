# Shadow Analysis

### Why do a shadow analysis?

### Mesh vs Polysurface

Mesh = easier for the computer; polysurface = easier for the user

------

Necessary plugins: GHOST, Ladybug

1. **File > Worksession > Attach** building files

2. File > Worksession > Attach terrain files

3. Copy the building and terrain files into their own layers

4. Use MeshSlice on the buildings, using the terrain as the cutting object. This is to make sure there aren't any 'negative' shadows generated by sections of the buildings underneath the ground.

5. Delete the sections of the buildings that are underneath the ground.

6. Use ReduceMesh on the remaining parts of the buildings. **What settings to use???**

7. The buildings are now ready to be imported into grasshopper. Open up grasshopper, importing the buildings and the terrain.

8. In order to determine the shadows, we'll need data on the sun and it's location.

9.
