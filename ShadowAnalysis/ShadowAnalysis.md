# Shadow Analysis - Wild Animals Plugin

### Why do a shadow analysis?

### What makes Wild Animals Ghost component different?

There are many other shadow analysis tools and workflows that are native to a variety of environments, so the fact that this plugin can do shadow analysis is not its defining feature. Instead, this component allows for analysis of individual buildings and structure's impacts on their environments, in a uniquely quantifiable way. **Finish this**


### What does the plugin do?

The plugin takes 5 inputs, and has 1 output (the 'out' output is temporary and currently used for development). Here's an explanation of how to use them and what they do:

#### Inputs:

 - **Geoms.**
   Short for geometry, the geoms input takes the buildings and structures that are going to be analysed for their shadow's impact. These can either meshes or polysurfaces, although it is worth considering which to use, [as is discussed here](#meshpoly).

Mesh = easier for the computer; polysurface = easier for the user

------

Necessary plugins: GHOST, Ladybug

1. **File > Worksession > Attach** building files

2. File > Worksession > Attach terrain files

3. Copy the building and terrain files into their own layers

4. Use MeshSlice on the buildings, using the terrain as the cutting object. This is to make sure there aren't any 'negative' shadows generated by sections of the buildings underneath the ground.

5. Delete the sections of the buildings that are underneath the ground.

6. Use ReduceMesh on the remaining parts of the buildings. **What settings to use???**

7. The buildings are now ready to be imported into grasshopper. Open up grasshopper, importing the buildings and the terrain.

8. In order to determine the shadows, we'll need data on the sun and it's location.
