## Issues

1. Why do a shadow analysis?

2. What does the plugin do?

3. Mesh vs Polysurface

### Why do a shadow analysis?

### What does the plugin do?

The plugin takes 5 inputs, and has 1 output (the 'out' output is temporary and currently used for development). Here's an explanation of how to use them and what they do:

#### Inputs:

 - **Geoms.**
 
   Short for geometry, the geoms input takes the buildings and structures that are going to be analysed for their shadow's impact. These can either meshes or polysurfaces, although it is worth considering which to use, [as is discussed here](#meshpoly).

 - **Context.**
 
   The context input takes the terrain that the buildings are on (and that the shadows will be projected on to). This can also either be a mesh or a polysurface.


 - **sunVec.**
 
   Short for Sun Vector(s), these represent the direction that the sun's light shines given its position. These are generated by the *sunPath* ladybug component - go to the [ladybug section in the standard workflow part of this document](#ladybug) to see how to do this.


 - **sunPos.**
 
   Short for Sun Position(s), these represent the position that the sun is in at each time of the day to be calculated. These are also generated by the *sunPath* ladybug component.


 - **A/I.**
 
   Short for ?? , this controls whether the shadows produced are seperated per building or not. This can be controlled by connecting a boolean toggle, where *True* means that the building's shadows are connected, and *False* means that each building is seperate.

#### Outputs:
 
 - **Shadow.**
 
   These are the shadows generated by the building(s) entered on the given terrain in the form of polyline curve(s). They follow the terrain, so unless the terrain is completely flat, these won't be planar.


### <a name="meshpoly">Mesh vs Polysurface</a>

Mesh = easier for the computer; polysurface = easier for the user





## Standard Workflow

1. **File preparation**

2. **File Downloads**

3. **Ladybug Setup**

4. **GHOST Component**

Necessary plugins: Wild Animals, Ladybug


### File Preparation

1. **File > Worksession > Attach** building files

2. **File > Worksession > Attach** terrain files

3. Copy the building and terrain files into their own layers

4. Use MeshSlice on the buildings, using the terrain as the cutting object. This is to make sure there aren't any 'negative' shadows generated by sections of the buildings underneath the ground.

5. Delete the sections of the buildings that are underneath the ground.

6. Use ReduceMesh on the remaining parts of the buildings. **What settings to use???**


### File Downloads

1. To get the relevant EPW (**E**nergy**P**lus **W**eather) files that ladybug requires, we'll need to visit [this website](http://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/).

2. After navigating to the relevant location, right click on the nearest circle. This will bring up a pop up with a url, copy it to the clipboard as it tells you to.

3. Go to the URL and download the zip folder. This contains the EPW file that ladybug will need.

4. Unzip the folder to access the files.


### <a name="ladybug">Ladybug Setup</a> 

1. In order to determine the shadows, we'll need data on the sun and it's location, which will be provided by ladybug. Assuming that you already have Ladybug installed (link to the install is [here](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ladybug-tools)), open up the grasshopper file that you'll be using.

2. Create the *Ladybug_Ladybug* component. This component doesn't need to be connected to anything, but just initialises some classes that other components need to run.

3. Create the *open weather file* component, and attach a boolean toggle to it.

4. Double click the boolean toggle - this should open up a window that will let you pick a file. Select the EPW file we downloaded earlier.

5. 

### GHOST Component

1. Open up grasshopper, importing the buildings and the terrain.
