*When it comes down to it I have no idea what I'm doing in revit so good luck.*

1. Ensure that the view templates have been correctly made so that each instance in the following list has been seperated appropriately:

 - Built in joinery
 - Core & columns
 - Doors
 - Facade
 - Floor finishes
 - Items overhead
 - Loose furniture
 - Walls & partitions
 
 *Note: These don't all need to be present. For whatever elements are present, creating view templates that logically seperate them is what is necessary*
